# Python_Data Visualization

Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets, which is essential for exploratory data analysis (EDA). In this repository, some codes for producing visualizations using popular Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas built-in and plotly are provided.

The following document is provided in this repository:
